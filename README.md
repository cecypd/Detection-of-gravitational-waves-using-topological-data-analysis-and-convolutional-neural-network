## Abstract
This article explores the integrated use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Persistent Homology techniques to enhance the detection of gravitational waves, phenomena predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. Gravitational waves are disturbances in space and time caused by astronomical events such as black hole collisions or supernova explosions. Traditionally, the detection of these waves has relied on laser interferometers, which are highly susceptible to environmental noise and require extensive physical infrastructure. This project proposes an alternative methodology that combines CNNs and Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to effectively filter and analyze noisy data, facilitating the identification of wave-indicative patterns without the need for large installations. Additionally, this approach not only improves the precision in wave detection but also significantly reduces the influence of environmental noise on measurements, enabling a better understanding of the origins and structure of the universe.

## 1. Introduction
Topology, defined as the study of properties preserved in objects under continuous deformations without tearing, has served as a fundamental pillar in mathematical analysis due to its ability to preserve structural characteristics. This discipline has evolved to include Topological Data Analysis (TDA), based on the idea that data presents a geometric structure that can be analyzed and quantified to address specific scientific questions. TDA employs a simplified representation of the shape of data to facilitate its study, making it an essential tool in various fields.

In engineering, topology facilitates the design of lightweight automotive components that optimize fuel efficiency and promote energy conservation. In biology, this discipline is applied to the design of DNA structures and the study of molecular dynamics during cellular events. Likewise, in computer sciences, topology helps characterize and analyze complex data systems, allowing better interpretation and management of information. From the perspective of theoretical physics, topology is instrumental in studying gravitational waves, predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity. These waves are distortions in spacetime caused by the accelerated movements of massive objects like stars, black holes, and planets. Detecting these waves is vital for understanding the origins of the universe and astronomical phenomena such as black holes, neutron stars, and supernovas.

However, the direct detection of gravitational waves is very difficult due to the impact of their effects and the environmental noise that can obscure real signals. Laser interferometers, which measure the tiny distance variations between fixed points, are the standard instruments for this task, although their effectiveness is compromised by noise susceptibility.

Building on this idea, this article presents an innovative approach that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with topological analysis techniques to improve gravitational wave detection in noisy environments. According to Christopher Bresten and Jae-Hum Jung, this method allows for more precise identification of gravitational wave signals without the need for extensive physical infrastructure. By integrating advanced computational tools, dependence on large physical installations is reduced, and handling of environmental noise is improved, representing significant progress in the ability to explore and understand the most enigmatic phenomena of spacetime.
